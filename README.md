**Week:** 1

---

## 📌 Task Description

### 🌟 Objective:

To begin Python programming and build a strong foundation through core syntax, control structures, data types, functions, and data manipulation.

### ✅ Tasks Completed:

* **Python Basics**

  * Explored Python data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `dict`
  * Applied conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
  * Used loops (`for`, `while`) for iteration
  * Defined and used functions for modular programming

* **Data Manipulation with Lists and Dictionaries**

  * Used `lists` and `dictionaries` to store, access, and process structured data
  * Implemented basic problems such as:

    * Counting word frequency
    * Grouping data by category (e.g., employee departments)
    * Filtering data (e.g., students passing all subjects)

* **Jupyter Notebook Practice**

  * **Notebook 1:** Implemented logic for palindromes, Armstrong numbers, power calculation, and digit analysis
  * **Notebook 2:** Created small applications like a contact book, student marks analyzer, and inventory manager

## 🧪 Challenges Faced

* Difficulty managing Python indentation in nested logic
* Confusion about mutable vs immutable data types
* Initial challenges in navigating Jupyter/Colab notebooks and understanding markdown formatting

### ⚖️ How They Were Resolved:

* Referred to official Python documentation and online tutorials (W3Schools, Programiz)
* Practiced small problems repeatedly to build confidence
* Took notes and revisited concepts through example-driven learning

---

## 📖 Learning Outcome

* Solidified understanding of Python programming fundamentals
* Gained practical experience in control structures and loops
* Strengthened problem-solving skills with custom functions and logic
* Learned to build and structure small functional Python scripts

---

## 📈 Next Steps (Week 2 Goals)

* Introduction to **NumPy** and **Pandas** libraries
* Learn array manipulation and DataFrame operations
* Explore CSV/Excel dataset handling
* Begin performing filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation on real data
